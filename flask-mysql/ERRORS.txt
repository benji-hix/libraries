ERRORS

'key error'
? tried to access a key that doesn't exist in dictionary
* changed '==' to '=' 
* opted to select all rather than specific fields in join function

'indexerror: tuple index out of range'
? tried to access an index that doesn't exist in a tuple

!!!Big errors caused by **form: 
the keys in **row take the name of the form value aka form_first_name
the name of values in %()s in query must reflect this.
